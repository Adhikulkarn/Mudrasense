Here's what to focus on:\n\n**What to adjust:**\n• Let's bring those fingers together, nice and close, touching each other.\n• Gently press your thumb more closely to the side of your palm.\n\n**You're doing well:**\n• Your fingers are extended! That's a great start!\n\nKeep practicing - you're making progress! Remember, mudras take time and patience to master. You've got this!\n",
