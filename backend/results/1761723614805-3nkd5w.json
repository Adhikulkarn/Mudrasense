Here's what to focus on:\n\n**What to adjust:**\n• The most important adjustment is to gently bend your thumb and press it against the side of your palm.\n• Try to keep your fingers closer together, so they are parallel and touching.\n\n**You're doing well:**\n• You are keeping your fingers straight, which is a great start for Pataka!\n\nKeep practicing - you're making progress!\n",
