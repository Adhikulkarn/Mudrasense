Here's what to focus on:\n\n**What to adjust:**\n• Let's try to tuck that thumb in just a bit more so it gently rests against the palm.\n• Also, make sure all fingers are perfectly straight - give them a little stretch!\n\n**You're doing well:**\n• Your fingers are nicely aligned, which is a great start for this mudra.\n\nKeep practicing - you're making progress!\n",
