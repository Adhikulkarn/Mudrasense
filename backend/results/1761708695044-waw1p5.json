  "feedback": "Good attempt at Pataka! You're on the right track. Here's what to focus on:\n\n**What to adjust:**\n• The thumb needs to be pressed more closely against the side of your palm. Think of it as gently hugging the palm.\n• Try to get all five fingers closer to one another so they are aligned and parallel.\n\n**You're doing well:**\n• Your fingers are straight, which is a great start for this mudra!\n\nKeep practicing - you're making progress!",
