  "feedback": "Good attempt at Pataka! You're on the right track. Here's what to focus on:\n\n**What to adjust:**\n• The fingers need to be held more closely together. Imagine they are all touching from base to tip!\n• Bend the thumb slightly and press it gently against the side of your palm.\n\n**You're doing well:**\n• Your fingers are straight, which is a great start.\n\nKeep practicing - you're making progress!\n",
